<p>Natural beauty is one with attractive features and looking attractive naturally without any makeup. It means your lips are beautiful without any lipstick or lip balm, your eyes are beautiful without any kajal or eye makeup, your face is shiny without any compact. Everybody has natural beauty.Nature is the lovely and attractive world with many beauties and wonders. It is an art of God and the rest of the things in the universe are artificial. It is created by god for the purpose of human beings. Nature is very essential to life and it is very much related with life. In the universe, there is nothing equal to the beauty of nature. In nature, no effort is made to create anything; the beauty on it comes naturally. But human beings are not appreciating it to the full. It teaches many valuable things to human. It teaches man to treat both happiness and sadness alike, in short nature is impressive and instructive.

	Life and nature are similar concepts, because nature is the study of life. If a person examines the beauty of nature, he may find some parallels in human lives and a nature world. For instance, the falling and ebbing of sea waves can be taken as an example. The falling suggests the ups in the human life and the ebbing suggests the downs of the human beings. The flower and thorns in a rose suggests that life has both pleasure and pains. It is good to spend time in nature, because it provides wisdom and pleasure to human being. There is a saying by John Keats’ that “a thing of beauty is a joy forever.</p>
